# Javascript developer test

Hello, thanks for reading my code :D 

I sticked with js because no lib was allowed.
I choose to filter with case-insensitive mode activated

to run the script: 
```
cd src/
node app.js (--filter=[str]) (--count)
```
or
```
npm start -- (--filter=[str]) (--count)
```

to run the tests: 
```
npm i
npm test
```
